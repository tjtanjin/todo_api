### Introduction
Todo Manager API is one of three small projects that form up the Todo Manager project that can be found here:

This repository contains work concerning the backend API server for Todo Manager, which serves our other two projects for the updating and retrieving of information.

### Features
Apart from providing basic create, read, update and delete functionalities pertaining to tasks, the API also provides a variety of means for updating users in order to deliver features that enhance user experience such as email notifications and password reset/verification features. The API is also responsible for deciding when to send which emails to our users so that they will always be kept up to date with the relevant information.
